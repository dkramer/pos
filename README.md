Hello World.

I used an h2 in memory DB.
I used plain JDBC to access the DB.
Opted for a DB to make sure my code runs and can be tested

Project Request:
Build a Spring rest service that accepts a long CustomerID and returns a Map<long InvoiceID, String TenderType>. This method will get all
invoices and tendertypes for that customerID from the invoice table. (schema of the table with sample data shown below).

Project Information:
Employ proper OO standards in your implementation.
Code should compile but does not need to be runnable.
Demonstrate best coding practices to the best of your ability
Comment items as necessary - but we will discuss this when we meet with you in the interview.

Assumptions:
The connection to the database can be mocked / assumed as a JDBC connection called "OREILLYPOS"
If you are not familiar with Spring - use whatever method you are comfortable with but be prepared to describe your solution.
